Game of Skate app made in React Native.

"SKATE, also known as the Game of Skate, is a skateboarding game using rules based upon the H.O.R.S.E. game played by basketball players.(...) One player sets a trick by doing a particular skateboarding trick of their choice. If the trick is not landed, another player attempts to set a trick. Once a trick has been set (landed), the other player(s) must respond by doing the same trick in their first try. If they make it the game continues; If every one gets the trick the player who set it gets a point if they miss it, they get a letter, starting with S, and so on, until they have missed five tricks, spelling SKATE, and they are out or the game is over. No trick may be set more than once in the same game and a skater defending on their last letter may receive two attempts at that trick. If the player lands the trick they have gained the lead and set the trick.

The last man standing is declared the winner and if they themselves did not receive a letter, then they are said to have "blanked, or "skunk'd" their opponent. When "Skater B" does not have the opportunity to set a single trick and does not match a single trick, "Skater A" is said to have committed a "Perfect Whitewash"" --Wikipedia

This project intends to create a general platform for a GoS, locating others skaters close to your location (pre-defined parks and usual skaters places) and manage the full game for the players, showing the score of each individual skater and trick sugestion, defined by the level setted in the begginig of the game.
